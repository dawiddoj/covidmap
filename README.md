# *CovidMap Poland*

### **Project is using HTML5 + JavaScript only.**
### **Website is made fully in Polish.**
### **Access to this website is possible by clicking [THIS](https://dojnik.github.io/covidmap/).** 

This webpage was made as a final project for a course named "Data communication and visualization".
Site structure contains three elements:
* **map of Poland divided into provinces**
* **data writing panel**
    * drop-down list of provinces,
    * input for number of transmissions, deaths and recovered patients,
    * three buttons responsible for respectively: saving data; drawing data on the map and graph; clearing data.
* **bar graph divided into provinces**
    * unlike map (where only number of transmissions is displayed), this graph displays all types of data collected from user.

## Map
Map displays data as a circle on the respective provinces. Diameter and colour of this circle changes with number of transmissions.

## Graph
Graph displays all types of data taken from user through writing panel.
